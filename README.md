# Data Science Syllabus

This repository is to showcase courses that my friend, [Cynthia](https://github.com/cynthziawong), and I have taken to begin our path in Data Science. 

We have compiled a list of online courses that provides afforadable education on various topics. Some courses provide capstone projects and while the project 
is important to understand everything that we have learned, we also look for side projects to help reinforce our education.

### Syllabus

The [***syllabus***](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AxaX1O_FBesAwd133R0PTaOppwErw-m1gTMkc5muE6Y/edit?usp=sharing) contains information 
on courses that we have taken so far, accompanied by side projects in between.

- The first sheet contains the current day's To Do and the next day or two's To Do.
- The second sheet contains the complete syllabus.
- The third sheet contains extra resources to read or watch when we need a small break.

If you are interested in using the same or similar syllabus format, please make a copy in your Google Drive. The only edits that need to be made is on the second sheet -
change the dates and the task to fit your schedule.
